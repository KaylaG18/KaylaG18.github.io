				Gender equality is a big issue in the world right now. A lot of people feel that men are superior to women but some others feel as if women are superior to men. In all honesty, women and men are in many ways different but can do most of the same things. Despite this common fact, women are still being treated as less than man, not hired for their gender, pay more for a product that would have costed more than its male counterpart.</p>

							<p>For many many years, different groups of people have been discrimated against for their skin color. This still plays a major role in society now. This is a reason for the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Many black people are getting killed by white police officers because the police have biased views torwards the black community. These police officers are not getting the proper consequences of their actions because they are seen as the superior race and it has been this way for over 200 years. With the upcoming 2016 elections and Donald Trump's campaign, the nation has come to realize some of the embedded hate toward the latin population, especially the illegal subgroup. To some who are not aware, the asian community has also sufferdd from inequality. Asians are regarded as invisible minority in many cases because they are not in any graph or any reports about minority groups in the united states. People need to know about this to create change as it is with other communities and their problems as well.
